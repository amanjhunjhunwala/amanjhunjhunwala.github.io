Welcome to my small corner of the internet !

I am a Robotics Research & Development Engineer for NVIDIA's Isaac Robotics Project. I work on the core robotics engine dwelling on the edges of the latest Reinforcement Learning research.


## Life Credits

I am a product of the time, effort and mentorship the following accomplished people have expended on me. I am and will always be eternally grateful to them

Till very recently, I was a graduate student in [Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at the University of Waterloo, working on the [Autonomoose](http://www.autonomoose.net/)  research project. I specialized on Behaviour Planning for Autonomous Driving, specializing in Reinforcment Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

Previously, I have worked on Deep Learning for 3D Vision at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html)'s [Autonomous Systems Lab](http://www.asl.ethz.ch/) under [Prof. Roland Siegwart](http://www.asl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.html?persid=29981), Marius Fehr, Thomas Schneider and Marcin Dymczyk on [Google X's Project Tango](https://get.google.com/tango/).

For the summer of 2016, I had the great fortune of working at the Center for Advanced Computing Research (now [Center for Data  Driven Discovery](http://cd3.caltech.edu/)) at [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu/) under the mentorship of ex-Director and current Principal Scientist, [Dr. Mark Stalzer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-stalzer-97254a/).

During the summer of 2015, I was a [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) participant and worked with Harvard University's Professor Tom Aldcroft, Dr. Jean Connelly and Dr. Thomas Robitaille and designed [AstroPython](http://astropython.org), currently the world's most popular website for using Python in Astronomy. 

I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering from [Birla Institute of Technology](https://bitmesra.ac.in/),India where I would tentatively be recieving an University Gold Medal for ranking 1st in the department. During my stay as an undergraduate, I was grateful that I was awarded the MITACS Globalink Fellowship (the highest undergraduate research honor awarded by the Canadian government) as well as the International SURF Fellowship by CalTech.
