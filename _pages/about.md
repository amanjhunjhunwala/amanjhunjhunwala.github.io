Hi! Thank you for taking the time out and visiting my homepage !

I am currently on co-op from my Masters programme as a Deep Learning Intern (DLI) at Nvidia Robotics Research (Santa Clara, HQ)  from May - December 2018.  

From September 2017 - April 2019, I am enrolled as a Masters Student in [Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at [Autonomoose](http://www.autonomoose.net/), a research collaboration under the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), Canada. I work on Behaviour Planning for Autonomous Driving, specializing in Reinforcment Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

Previously, I have worked on Deep Learning for 3D Vision at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html)'s [Autonomous Systems Lab](http://www.asl.ethz.ch/) under [Prof. Roland Siegwart](http://www.asl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.html?persid=29981), Marius Fehr, Thomas Schneider and Marcin Dymczyk on [Google X's Project Tango](https://get.google.com/tango/).

For the summer of 2016, I had the great fortune of working at the Center for Advanced Computing Research (now [Center for Data  Driven Discovery](http://cd3.caltech.edu/)) at [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu/) under the mentorship of ex-Director and current Principal Scientist, [Dr. Mark Stalzer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-stalzer-97254a/).


During the summer of 2015, I was a [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) participant and worked with Harvard University's Professor Tom Aldcroft, Dr. Jean Connelly and Dr. Thomas Robitaille and designed [AstroPython](http://astropython.org), currently the world's most popular website for using Python in Astronomy. 


I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering from [Birla Institute of Technology](https://bitmesra.ac.in/),India where I would tentatively be recieving an University Gold Medal for ranking 1st in the department. During my stay as an undergraduate, I was grateful that I was awarded the MITACS Globalink Fellowship (the highest undergraduate research honor awarded by the Canadian government) as well as the International SURF Fellowship by CalTech. 

Apart from research, I love software and web development! I have won multiple university level hackathons and was one of Microsoft's Build The Shield India finalists for 2016.

I also won a Logo  Quiz back in the day and am still waiting for my prize. Please email me directly if you have any details regarding the same.
